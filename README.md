# Sand-Game-Project
This was a project for the first semester of coding at my community college and we had to make our own version of the known game "Falling Sand". 
The class was CIS36 and this is one our of 3 projects I had made in that class.

Falling sand is a game where the user can interact by placing and removing particles such as ( Sand, Water, and Metal) on a canvas which can interact with other 
particles in various ways.
