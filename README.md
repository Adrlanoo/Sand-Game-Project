# Sand-Game-Project
This was a project for the first semester of coding at my community college and we had to make our own version of the known game "Falling Sand".

Falling sand is a game where the user can interact by placing and removing particles such as ( Sand, Water, and Metal) on a canvas which can interact with other 
particles in various ways.
